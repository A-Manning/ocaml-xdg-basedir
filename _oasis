Synopsis:    XDG basedir location for data/cache/configuration files
Description:
  This library implements the xdg-basedir specification. It helps to define
  standard locations for configuration, cache and data files in the user
  directory and on the system.
  .
  It is a straightforward implementation on UNIX platform and try to apply
  consistent policies with regard to Windows directories.
  .
  It is inspired by the Haskell implementation of this specification, and it
  follows the same choices for Windows directories.
  .
  [The xdg-basedir specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).
  and
  [the Haskell implementation](http://github.com/willdonnelly/xdg-basedir)
  and
  [the API of this implementation](http://xdg-basedir.forge.ocamlcore.org/api).
